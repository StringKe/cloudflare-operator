          CloudflareSyncState stores the aggregated configuration state for a Cloudflare resource.
          It acts as a shared state store between multiple K8s resource controllers and the
          Sync Controller that performs the actual Cloudflare API synchronization.

          This resource is managed internally by the operator and should not be created or
          modified by users directly. It enables:
          - Multi-controller coordination without race conditions
          - Multi-instance operator deployments with K8s optimistic locking
          - Efficient batching and deduplication of API calls
          - Observable sync state via kubectl
