          PagesDomain manages a custom domain for a Cloudflare Pages project.
          Custom domains allow you to serve your Pages project from your own domain
          instead of the default *.pages.dev subdomain.

          The controller adds and manages custom domains for Pages projects,
          including SSL certificate provisioning and DNS validation.
