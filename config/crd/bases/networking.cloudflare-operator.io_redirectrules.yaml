          RedirectRule manages Cloudflare Redirect Rules (Single Redirects).
          Redirect Rules allow you to create URL redirects with static or dynamic targets.

          Two syntaxes are supported:
          - Rules: Expression-based rules for complex redirect logic
          - WildcardRules: Wildcard pattern rules for simpler use cases

          This is a simplified interface over ZoneRuleset for redirect use cases.
