          TransformRule manages Cloudflare Transform Rules.
          Transform Rules allow you to modify HTTP requests and responses:
          - URL Rewrites: Change the URL path and/or query string
          - Request Headers: Add, modify, or remove HTTP request headers
          - Response Headers: Add, modify, or remove HTTP response headers

          This is a simplified interface over ZoneRuleset for common transform use cases.
